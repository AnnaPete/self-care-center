# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
 I have created a simple program where users can receive randomly generated mantras and affirmations to assist them in their own self-care regimen. Users can also add their own mantras and affirmations to each respective list.

### Installation Instructions:
 To clone the program and get it up and running, first go to https://github.com/AnnaPete/self-care-center. Fork the repository (top right hand side), and clone to the local machine by copying the SSH key and entering "git clone [SSH Key]" into the machine's terminal to create a local working repository. Open the application in the default internet browser by typing "open index.html" into the terminal.
